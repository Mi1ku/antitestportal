## 🚀 Key Features

### 🛡️ Ghost Shield EX
Our advanced bypass engine that renders you invisible to Testportal's focus tracking.
- **Undetectable:** Fakes `document.hasFocus` and `visibilityChange`.
- **Silent Mode:** Automatically silences all "cheat detection" signals from the server.
- **Auto-Smart Sleep:** The Ghost module intentionally turns itself off via path detection on `LoadTestStart` and `test-result` pages to assure a bug-free experience.

### ❄️ Time Freeze Pro
Take control of the clock. Stop the countdown whenever you need more time to think.
- **Sync Engine:** Allows for manual server-side time synchronization.
- **Freeze Mode:** Holds the timer at its current state locally.

### 🧠 SUPREME AI CORTEX (Auto-Clicker & Side Dock)
Instant access to solutions and automatic test answering without breaking immersion.
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash Auto-Solver:** If Auto-Answer Genius is active, the extension will instantly read the question, ping the AI model, and highlight the correct option on the test for you. 
- **Developer Bound API Key:** End-users don't have to provide any keys. The Gemini API key is securely embedded in the `config.ts` file before the deploy phase.
- **AI Solver Status Bar:** Contains a visually stunning animation predicting AI response times and reading status.
- **Instant Frames (Free Mode):** Connects directly with Perplexity / Google, feeding it your questions natively in a 400px side window.
- **Panic Mode:** Hide everything completely with a smooth transition using `Shift + Q` or toggle dock with `Shift + B`.
